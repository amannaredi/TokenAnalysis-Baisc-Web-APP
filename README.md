# Token Analysis Flask App

This Flask web application is designed to analyze small-cap token projects using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. Users can submit details about their token project, and the application will provide an AI-generated analysis based on the provided information.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/token-analysis-flask-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd token-analysis-flask-app
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

## Usage

1. Before running the application, you need to set up the necessary environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    MAIL_USERNAME=your_email_address
    MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
    ```

    Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your OpenAI API key, `your_email_address` with the email address from which you want to send reports, and `your_email_password` with the corresponding email password.

2. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

4. Fill out the form with details about your token project and submit it.

5. The application will generate an AI analysis based on the provided information and send it to the specified email address.
